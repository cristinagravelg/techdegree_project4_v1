This project consists of creating a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." 

It uses JavaScript and OOP to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

As part of the project, I will work on creating JavaScrip classes with specific properties and methods.

The way the game works is as follows:

A random phrase will be selected, it will be split into letters, and those letters will be added onto the gameboard.

Each time a player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase.

If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen.

A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. 

I hope you enjoy playing!
